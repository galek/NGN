It seems that ASSIMP does not import any metadata from any file format, so that we cannot use custom properties in Blender and import them in ASSIMP.
Also Blender doesn't export custom properties in any format (except .blend)

The obvious way out is to write a custom exporter.

We need a binary file format for fast model loading anyway (for scene loading in general probably), so maybe we can teach that format to hold metadata as well.

example of someone who did it already:
http://www.moddb.com/groups/blenderheads/news/kravall-level-editor
Model-Library (Asset-Folder-Referenz), super-files f√ºr einzelne game-objects ("templates")
Export-Path + Quick-Export-Button + Keyboardshortcut
Navigation-Meshes, Event-Areas, Trigger

Already exports name, position, rotation, scale, custom properties - Enough for most gamejam games!

Tag some objects with a property (or special name), don't even use the geometry, just transforms etc.
Empty objects are groups or represent single objects
