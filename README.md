# NGN
NGN is a game engine I'm writing and it's mostly intended for game jams, but it should be usable for projects that are a little bigger as well. 

You can have a look at [main.cpp](https://github.com/pfirsich/NGN/blob/master/src/main.cpp) to see example usage.
You can also have a look at a [Screenshot](https://github.com/pfirsich/NGN/raw/master/screenshot.png) that will be generated every time I close the test program (sorry GitHub :/). To see what I'm working on next/at the moment, have a look at my [todo](https://github.com/pfirsich/NGN/blob/master/notes/ngn.todo), which is kind of messy and partly in German (I apologize for that).
